# MongoRest
> A helper library build on top of 'pymongo' which allows developer to use 
MongoDB in RESTful style.

# Why MongoRest?
> MongoDB is a greate database model but its APIs is quite confusing and 
overcomplicated to use. MongoRest eliminates those overheats by simplifying 
everything to RESTful style.

# What MongoRest does?
> It group all operations into 4 basic functions: POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE, 
and their batch counterparts: POST_BATCH, PUT_BATCH, and DELETE_BATCH. Unlike
'pymongo', which returns 'cursor' or a 'ResultObject', all returns are 
inform of 'dictionary'.
